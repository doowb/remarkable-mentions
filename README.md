Transform @ mentions into markdown links.

## Install

Install with [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/):

```sh
$ npm install --save remarkable-mentions
```

## Usage

```js
var mentions = require('remarkable-mentions');
```

## API

### [mentions](index.js#L22)

Remarkable plugin that will turn all @ mentions into a link. This is done just after block tokenizing to ensure that the inline blocks are transformed before links are transformed. This also ensures that @ mentions inside code blocks are not transformed.

**Params**

* `options` **{Object}**: Options to control how the @ mentions are transformed. See [to-mention-link][] for more options.
* `options.url` **{String}**: Customize the url that is used in the links. Defaults to "https://github.com".
* `returns` **{Function}**: Remarkable plugin function that can be passed to the `.use` method.

**Example**

```js
var md = new Remarkable();
md.use(mentions());
var html = md.render(markdown);
```
